RANDOM BOT - A Reference Implementation for Students
==============================================================================

This bot makes random decisions and serves as an educational example.
Use this as a starting point to understand how bots work, then create
your own bot with better strategy!

HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN BOT:
1. Create a new .py file in the bots/ directory
2. Copy this file's structure
3. Implement smarter logic in each method
4. Run: python -m game.main --bot bots/your_bot.py:2

KEY CONCEPTS:
- BotView: Your "window" into the game (only shows what you're allowed to see)
- Action: What you want to do (play a card, draw, chat)
- GameEvent: Something that happened in the game
- Card: A card object with properties like card_type, name, etc.
