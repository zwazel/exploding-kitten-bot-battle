# Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based bot battle card game framework. Students write bots that compete against each other.

## Key Patterns

### Type Safety
- **Always** declare types for all variables, parameters, and return values
- Use `pyright` in strict mode for type checking
- Prefer `tuple` over `list` for immutable sequences exposed to bots

### Anti-Cheat Architecture
- `GameState` is **never** exposed directly to bots
- Bots receive a `BotView` - a safe, read-only snapshot
- `BotView` only contains information the bot is allowed to see

### Card System
- Each card type is a class extending `Card` base class
- Cards define their own behavior via `can_play()`, `execute()`, etc.
- Card instances are created from the `CardRegistry` based on config

### Event History
- Every game action creates a `GameEvent`
- Events are recorded in `GameHistory` for future replay
- Use `GameEvent` for both history and bot notifications

### Deterministic RNG
- All randomness goes through `DeterministicRNG`
- Same seed = same game outcome (given same bot behavior)
- Useful for testing and debugging

## File Organization

```
src/game/           # Core engine (protected)
  ├── cards/        # Card base class and registry
  └── bots/         # Bot interface and loader
bots/               # User bots (loaded at runtime)
configs/            # Deck configurations
tests/              # Test suite
```

## Testing

- Use seeded RNG for deterministic tests
- Test cards in isolation before integration
- Verify `BotView` doesn't leak protected information

## Game Setup Rules

Per official Exploding Kittens rules, `setup_game` follows this flow:
1. Remove Exploding Kittens and Defuse cards from deck
2. Validate Defuse count ≥ (players + 1) - **warns and auto-adds if needed**
3. Generate exactly **(players - 1)** Exploding Kittens at runtime
4. Deal initial hands (7 cards) from safe cards only
5. Give each player 1 Defuse card
6. Shuffle Exploding Kittens and remaining Defuse cards back into deck

**Note:** `ExplodingKittenCard` should NOT be in deck config - always auto-generated.
